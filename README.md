# MERN_AI_Image_Generation

MERN_AI_Image_Generation is a full-stack web application that generates images using OpenAI API. It is built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The application also utilizes Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool, to simplify database operations.

## Technologies Used

* MongoDB
* Express.js
* React.js
* Node.js
* Mongoose
* Vite
* Tailwind CSS

## Functionality

The application allows users to generate images by specifying certain parameters such as the type of image, the size, and the style. The parameters are sent to the OpenAI API, which then generates the image and returns it to the user. The generated image is then saved in the MongoDB database and displayed on the user's screen.
